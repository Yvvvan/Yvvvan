## ACA - Fundamentals

> 重点是[量化原理](#quantitatice-priciples)，其他是简单的定义。

### Trends

### Classes of Computers

* Desktop
* Server
* Embedded Computer
* Personal Mobile Devices
* Warehouse-scale Computers

### Computer Architect/Design

Determine the important attributes

Design a machine to

* maximize performance and energy efficiency
* stay within cost, power and availability constraints

Including:

* Instruction set design
* Functional organization (u-architecture)
* Logic design and implementation
* Assist marketing, sales, customers
* Validation and debug support

### Computer Architecture

* Instruction set architecture
* Organization (micro architecture)
* Hardware (Detailed logic design and packaging tech.)

### Trends in Power in IC

Issues: 

* Get In: Bring Power to the Chip
* Get out: Remove Heat

> Why: Battery Life, Power Consumption, Environment, Power Density

### Performance

$Performance = \frac{1}{Execution Time}$

> Increasing performance means decreasing execution time

Execution Time can be defined in different ways:

- Wall-clock Time = response time = elapsed time

  The latency to complete a task. Includes Everything: disk accesses, I/O, OS overhead, ...

- CPU Time

  CPU computing time, not time waiting for I/O or other programs

  - User CPU Time : CPU time spent in the program
  - System CPU Time: CPU time spent in OS

#### Benchmarks

a program used to evaluate performance.

Five types *(in order of accuracy)*:

- Real applications
- Modified (or scripted) applications
- Kernels
- Toy benchmarks
- Synthetic benchmarks

#### Benchmark Suites

a collection of benchmarks that measure the performance with a variety of apps.

> Most successful attempt tp create a standard: SPEC
>
> - Processor-intensive Benchmarks: 
>   - SPEC SPU 2006
> - Graphics-intensive Benchmarks
>   - SPECviewperf
>   - SPECapc
> - Server Benchmarks
>   - SPECSFS
>   - SPECWeb

#### Embedded Benchmarks

Less developed than desktop (CPU+GPU) and server benchmarks.

> One attempt: EDN Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark
> Consortium (EEMBC)

Kernels and benchmarks that fall into 5 classes

- Automotive/industrial
- Consumer
- Networking
- Office automation
- Telecommunications

#### Summarizing Performance

- total execution time: summary from all programs in one Computer
- arithmetic mean: $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{Time}_i$

if the programs are not run equally?

- `weighted` execution time: $\sum_{i=1}^n{Weight}_i \cdot {Time}_i$ 

- `normalized` execution time (Used by SPEC): 

  Normalize execution times to a reference machine and take average

  `SPECRatio` = $\frac{Execution Time_{reference}}{Execution Time}$

  don’t use the arithmetic mean to average normalized execution time

  > lead to different results depending on the reference machine

  use `geometric mean`

### Quantitatice Priciples

#### Amdahls' Law

to calculate the improvement of performance by using a enhancement E

`speedup` = $\frac{ExTime \quad without \quad E}{ExTime \quad with \quad E}$

if the enhancement E accelerates a fraction F of the whole task by a factor S. The new execution time can be calculated as:

$T_{new} = (1-F) \cdot T_{old} + F \cdot T_{old} / S$

The overall speedup is:

$Speedup = \frac{T_{old}}{T_{new}} = (1-F+\frac{F}{S})^{-1}$

#### CPU Performance Equation

`Cycle time` : reciprocal of CPU frequency/`Clock rate f`  *Cycle time = rate$^{-1}$* (e.g. 1 GHz: 1 ns) 

`IC`: Instruction count (or instruction path length) = number of instructions executed

`CPI` : cycles per instruction = **Cycle count** / IC

so `CPU time` = Cycle count for a program × Cycle time = IC × CPI × Cycle time

> That means, CPU performance **equally** depends on `IC`, `CPI` and `frequency`.

> 10% improvement in any of them leads to 10% overall improvement.

By designing CPU, it is useful to calculate the number of total CPU clock cycles as:

CPU clock cycles (Cycle count) = $\sum_{i=1}^{n}IC_i \times CPI_i$  (指令数 × 每条指令需要的周期数)

Sometimes we know how many cycles each instruction takes and the frequency of each instruction. The average CPI can be calculated as:<br/>

CPI =  $\sum_{i=1}^{n}CPI_i\times Freq_{i}$ <br/>

where<br/>- $CPI_i$ is the average CPI for instruction i<br/>- $Freq_{i} = IC_i / IC$ is the frequency of instruction i

#### Design Principles

to Make Processors Faster

- Take advantage of parallelism
- Principle of locality
- Make the common case fast
