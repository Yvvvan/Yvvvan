## ACA - Fundamentals

> 重点是[Performance](#Performance)[量化原理](#quantitatice-priciples)，其他是简单的定义。

### Trends

### Classes of Computers

* Desktop

* Server

* Embedded Computer

  distinguish 2 more classes:

* Personal Mobile Devices

* Warehouse-scale Computers

### Computer Architect/Design

Determine the important attributes

Design a machine to

* maximize performance and energy efficiency
* stay within cost, power and availability constraints

Including:

* Instruction set design
* Functional organization (u-architecture)
* Logic design and implementation
* Assist marketing, sales, customers
* Validation and debug support

### Computer Architecture

> is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance and cost goals.

* Instruction set architecture
* Organization (micro architecture)
* Hardware (Detailed logic design and packaging tech.)

### Trends in Power in IC

Issues: 

* Get In: Bring Power to the Chip
* Get out: Remove Heat

> Why: Battery Life, Power Consumption, Environment, Power Density

### Performance

- Time:

  1. $Performance = \frac{1}{Execution Time}$

     1. Increasing performance means decreasing execution time

        > Execution Time can be defined in different ways:

        - Wall-clock Time = response time = elapsed time

          The latency to complete a task. Includes Everything: disk accesses, I/O, OS overhead, ...

        - CPU Time *(when talking about the time of a program)

          CPU computing time, not time waiting for I/O or other programs

          - User CPU Time : CPU time spent in the program
          - System CPU Time: CPU time spent in OS

  2. Throughput / Rate = n jobs / second

  > multiprogrammed CPU works on other process when current process stalled for I/O. It does not improve the execution time of current process, but improve the throughput.

- Availability: the percentage of time, a system is up and running

- Scalability: the ability of a system to expand performance

- Performance per Watt: the number of flops per watt of power as seen before 

#### Benchmarks

a program used to **evaluate performance**.

Five types *(in order of accuracy high to low)*:

- Real applications
  - portability problems 
  - important activity has to be eliminated
- Modified (or scripted) applications
  - enhance portability 增强可移植性 以便多平台运行
  - forcus on particular aspect of system performance
    - e.g. CUP-oriented benchmarks will remove I/O
  - scripts to reproduce interactive behaviour
- Kernels
  - small, key pieces from real programs (key = consume lots of Ex Time)
  - best used to isolate the performance of certain features
- Toy benchmarks
  - small, easy but not useful ti evaluate perf
- Synthetic benchmarks
  - typical instruction mixes
  - whetstone and dhrystone

#### Benchmark Suites

**a collection of benchmarks** that measure the performance with a variety of apps.

> Most successful attempt tp create a standard: SPEC (focuses on CPU)
>
> - Processor-intensive Benchmarks: 
>   - SPEC SPU 2006
> - Graphics-intensive Benchmarks
>   - SPECviewperf: OpenGL 3D rendering
>   - SPECapc: extensive use of graphics
> - Server Benchmarks with significant I/O
>   - SPECSFS: serve
>   - SPECWeb: web

#### Embedded Benchmarks

Less developed than desktop (CPU+GPU) and server benchmarks. (嵌入式系统各不相同，各自设计各自的benchmark)

> One attempt: EDN Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark
> Consortium (EEMBC)

Kernels and benchmarks that fall into 5 classes

- Automotive/industrial
- Consumer
- Networking
- Office automation
- Telecommunications

#### Summarizing Performance

- total execution time: summary from all programs in one Computer
- arithmetic mean: $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{Time}_i$

if the programs are not run equally?

- `weighted` execution time: $\sum_{i=1}^n{Weight}_i \cdot {Time}_i$ 

- `normalized` execution time (Used by SPEC): 

  Normalize execution times to a *reference machine* and take average

  `SPECRatio` = $\frac{Execution Time_{reference}}{Execution Time}$

  don’t use the arithmetic mean to average normalized execution time

  > lead to different results depending on the reference machine

  use `geometric mean`

### Quantitatice Priciples

#### CPU Performance Equation

`Cycle time` : reciprocal of CPU frequency/`Clock rate f`  *Cycle time = rate$^{-1}$* (e.g. 1 GHz: 1 ns) 

`IC`: Instruction count (or instruction path length) = number of instructions executed

`CPI` : cycles per instruction = **Cycle count** / IC

so `CPU time` = Cycle count for a program × Cycle time = IC × CPI × Cycle time

> That means, CPU performance **equally** depends on `IC`, `CPI` and `frequency`.
>
> 10% improvement in any of them leads to 10% overall improvement.
>
> We can improve that in:

By designing CPU, it is useful to calculate the number of total CPU clock cycles as:

CPU clock cycles (Cycle count) = $\sum_{i=1}^{n}IC_i \times CPI_i$  (指令数 × 每条指令需要的周期数)

Sometimes we know how many cycles each instruction takes and the frequency of each instruction. The average CPI can be calculated as:<br/>

CPI =  $\sum_{i=1}^{n}CPI_i\times Freq_{i}$ <br/>

where<br/>- $CPI_i$ is the average CPI for instruction i<br/>- $Freq_{i} = IC_i / IC$ is the frequency of instruction i

> 即 知道每个Op的周期，知道每个Op的占比，但不知道每个Op有多少IC

#### Amdahls' Law

to calculate the improvement of performance by using a enhancement E

`speedup` = $\frac{ExTime \quad without \quad E}{ExTime \quad with \quad E}$

if the enhancement E accelerates a fraction F of the whole task by a factor S. The new execution time can be calculated as:

$T_{new} = (1-F) \cdot T_{old} + F \cdot T_{old} / S$

The overall speedup is:

$Speedup = \frac{T_{old}}{T_{new}} = (1-F+\frac{F}{S})^{-1}$

> 最大speedup  (即S趋向正无穷) 是 1-f 的倒数

> Focus on the Common Case (优化大的部分很赚 80%快2倍 还是 20%快10倍)

> Law of diminishing returns: optimizations will have less and less effects

#### Design Principles

to Make Processors Faster

- Take advantage of parallelism：next chapter
- Principle of locality: 
  - Programs spend 90% of their execution time in 10% of their code
  - can predict with reasonable accuracy which instructions and data program will use in near future
- Make the common case fast

   >
   > $Speedup_2 = ((1-0.5) + 0.5 / 10 ) ^ {-1} = 1.818$

7. improve part of our application by a factor of 4 and want to achieve an overall speedup of 2. How large should the fraction be.

   >
   > $F = 2/3$

8. In an application 50% instructions take 1 cycle, 20%  take 2 cycles, 30% take 2.4 cycles on average. What is the average CPI? This application executes 1.6x10$^9$ instructions and the clock frequency is 3GHz. How much time does the program take?

   > $CPI = 50\% \times 1 + 20\% \times 2 + 30\% \times 2.4 = 1.62$ 
   >
   > $IC =  1.6 \times 10^9 \qquad f =3 \times 10^9 Hz$
   >
   > $T = IC \times CPI \times f^{-1} = 1.6 \times 10^9 \times 1.62 \times (3 \times 10^9)^{-1} = 0.864 s$
